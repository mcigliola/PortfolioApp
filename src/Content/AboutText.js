const AboutText = ` 
Welcome to my corner of the cosmos! I'm a software developer with a background as an educator and a passion for building user-friendly, intuitive applications. My journey into software development is rooted in a lifelong love of problem-solving and creative thinking-skills I honed during my years teaching adult basic education, English as a Second Language, and digital literacy courses.

When I made the transition into technology, I brought with me the same dedication to empowering others that defined my teaching career. I thrive on challenges that push me to learn new technologies and approaches. My portfolio reflects this drive, featuring work in React, Angular, Android and more. I see coding as a blend of logic and creativity, where every project is an opportunity to create something meaningful.

Beyond coding, I'm inspired by language, history, and space.

Let's explore what we can build together!
